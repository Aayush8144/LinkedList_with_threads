# LinkedList_with_threads

It is a console program.
Stack is implemented with LinkedList as its base
Stach has following operation/functionality to it:
  1) print the list
  2) search the list for all of possible entries of the user defined data
  3) add to the end of the list
  4) delete last node/element of the list


The linked list uses fixed threads to execute add, delete Last, and search operation on the list.


============================================================================================

Feel free to add more functionality to it.
I would really appriceate if you give me some credit though, if you use this c program as a base.
